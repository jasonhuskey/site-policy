### The Huskey Practice Manager Terms of Service
Effective date: July 21, 2017


### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Huskey Practice Manager Privacy Statement, available at [huskeypracticemanager.com/site/privacy](https://huskeypracticemanager.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [help.huskeypracticemanager.com/categories/site-policy](/categories/site-policy/).
2. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Huskey Practice Manager.
3. The “Website” refers to Huskey Practice Manager’s website located at [huskeypracticemanager.com](https://huskeypracticemanager.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by Huskey Practice Manager at or through the Website. It also refers to Huskey Practice Manager-owned subdomains of huskeypracticemanager.com.
4. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See [Section B(4): Additional Terms](#4-additional-terms)).
5. “Huskey Practice Manager,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Huskeyweb LLC, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Paid Content” is Content only available to Users who are participating in a payment plan.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; and you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.*

#### 1. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 2. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for accounts on Huskey Practice Manager's Service.
- You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.  
- You must be age 13 or older. Huskey Practice Manager does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.
- Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.

#### 3. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. The content of your account and its security are up to you.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Huskey Practice Manager cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify Huskey Practice Manager](https://Huskey Practice Manager.com/contact) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store and display your Content and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. 

That means you're giving us the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and your team members); modify it (so our server can do things like parse it into a search index); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with your team members). 

This license does not grant Huskey Practice Manager the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.

#### 5. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section.

To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Huskey Practice Manager a nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to (1) use the Content without attribution strictly as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section. We need these rights to allow basic functions like search to work.
